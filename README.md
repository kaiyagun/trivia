trivia game

Point-based trivia game with timed questions and expanding access to new features based on user score.

Presented with options for quiz and a "start quiz" button on homepage

Linked to open trivia API for questions, https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

results can have pos/neg feedback from either https://evilinsult.com/api/#generate-insult-get API or a cute image generator

localStorage holds scores for returning users (and therefore holds the memory for using the new unlocked features)
