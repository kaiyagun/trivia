Question cards present the user with a question pulled from Trivia API, and 4 possible answer buttons.

Correct answers are rewarded with 10 points, and the ending page varies depending on percentage of correct answers.

Individual questions also have a 10 seconds timer, that if it runs out it results in the question being marked as incorrect.
